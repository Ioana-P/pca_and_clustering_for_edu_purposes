# pca_cluster_for_edu_purposes
Upon request from students in their final cohort, I ran a short tutorial on Principal Component Analysis (and one example of truncated Singular Value Decomposition) and on on a few different types of clustering.
The Jupyter Notebooks are left un-refactored on purpose for showing code application to students. 

Each of the 3 notebooks illustrates a process of performing PCA and Clustering on a different canonical dataset, respectively:
 - sklearn's glass dataset
 - sklearn's wine dataset
 - sklearn's 20 Newsgroups dataset
 
 The final notebook (for those who wish to see an extra example of NLP) contains examples of NLP preprocessing as well. Hope students find this helpful.
